# Bybit Algorithmic Trading System - Technical Documentation

## Project Overview

The Bybit Algorithmic Trading System is a comprehensive, modular cryptocurrency trading platform designed to automate trading strategies on the Bybit exchange. The system supports multiple trading strategies, risk management features, backtesting capabilities, and a real-time dashboard for monitoring and controlling trading operations.

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components

1. **Main Application** (`src/main.py`): The entry point for the system that orchestrates all components. It supports three operating modes:

   - Backtesting mode
   - Paper trading mode
   - Live trading mode

2. **Dashboard** (`run_dashboard.py`, `src/dashboard/`): A web-based monitoring and control interface built with Dash/Plotly that visualizes trading activities, portfolio performance, and allows for real-time control of the trading system.

3. **API Integration** (`src/api/`): Components that handle communication with the Bybit exchange API.

   - `bybit_client.py`: Main client interface
   - Specialized modules for market data, orders, account information, and WebSocket connections

4. **Market Data** (`src/data/`): Handles acquisition, storage, and preprocessing of market data.

5. **Trading Strategies** (`src/strategies/`): A collection of trading strategies, each implementing a different approach to market analysis.

   - Base strategy class that provides common functionality
   - Multiple strategy implementations (EMA crossover, RSI reversal, MACD trend following, etc.)
   - Strategy manager for coordination between strategies

6. **Indicators** (`src/indicators/`): Technical indicators used by trading strategies.

7. **Risk Management** (`src/risk_management/`): Components for managing trading risk.

8. **Trade Management** (`src/trade_management/`): Handles order execution and position management.

9. **Performance** (`src/performance/`): Tracks and analyzes trading performance.

10. **Paper Trading** (`src/paper_trading/`): Simulates trading without using real funds.

11. **Backtesting** (`src/testing/`): Allows testing strategies on historical data.

12. **Configuration** (`src/config/`): Manages system configuration and settings.

13. **Utils** (`src/utils/`): General utility functions and helpers.

## Technology Stack

The system utilizes the following technologies:

- **Python 3**: Core programming language
- **ccxt**: Cryptocurrency exchange trading library
- **pandas/numpy**: Data analysis and manipulation
- **pandas-ta**: Technical analysis indicators
- **Dash/Plotly**: Dashboard and data visualization
- **Backtrader**: Backtesting framework
- **Loguru**: Logging system
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management
- **WebSocket**: Real-time data streaming

## Trading Strategies

The system implements multiple trading strategies including:

1. **EMA Crossover**: Uses exponential moving average crossovers to identify trend changes
2. **RSI Reversal**: Identifies potential reversals using the Relative Strength Index
3. **Bollinger Mean Reversion**: Trades mean reversion with Bollinger Bands
4. **MACD Trend Following**: Uses MACD indicator for trend following
5. **Breakout Trading**: Identifies and trades price breakouts
6. **VWAP Trend Trading**: Uses Volume Weighted Average Price for trend identification
7. **ATR Volatility Scalping**: Scalps markets based on volatility measured by Average True Range
8. **ADX Strength Confirmation**: Uses ADX to confirm trend strength
9. **Golden Cross**: Identifies long-term trend changes with MA crossovers
10. **Keltner Channel Breakout**: Trades breakouts from Keltner Channels

Each strategy is configurable with custom parameters.

## Risk Management

The system includes comprehensive risk management features:

- Position sizing based on account balance and risk percentage
- Stop-loss and take-profit order management
- Trailing stops for capturing more profit
- Maximum daily drawdown limits
- Circuit breaker mechanisms to pause trading after consecutive losses
- Maximum open positions limits
- Leverage control

## Dashboard Features

The dashboard provides:

- Real-time portfolio performance monitoring
- Trade history and active positions
- Strategy performance comparison
- Orderbook visualization
- Market data charts
- Strategy control panels
- Risk management settings
- System notifications
- Performance metrics and analytics

## Configuration System

The system uses a hierarchical configuration system:

- Default configuration in `src/config/default_config.json`
- User-specific configuration overrides
- Command-line parameter overrides
- Environment variables for sensitive data (API keys)

## Data Flow

1. Market data is retrieved from Bybit API
2. Data is processed and technical indicators are calculated
3. Trading strategies analyze the data and generate signals
4. Risk management evaluates and potentially modifies signals
5. Trade management executes the trades
6. Performance tracking records and analyzes results
7. Dashboard visualizes all activities in real-time

## Getting Started

The system supports three main operational modes:

1. **Backtesting Mode**: Test strategies on historical data

   ```
   python src/main.py --config config/backtest_config.yaml --backtest
   ```

2. **Paper Trading Mode**: Simulate trading without real funds

   ```
   python src/main.py --config config/paper_trading_config.yaml
   ```

3. **Live Trading Mode**: Execute trades with real funds
   ```
   python src/main.py --config config/live_trading_config.yaml
   ```

Additionally, the dashboard can be run separately:

```
python run_dashboard.py --mode paper --config config/paper_trading_config.yaml
```

## Security Considerations

- API keys stored in environment variables
- Testnet for testing without real funds
- Confirmation dialog for live trading
- Trading limits and risk controls

## Areas for Improvement

1. Additional exchanges beyond Bybit
2. More advanced machine learning strategies
3. Integration with external data sources
4. Enhanced portfolio optimization
5. Automated strategy parameter optimization
6. More sophisticated risk management algorithms
7. Cloud deployment options
8. Mobile notifications and control

## Dependency Management

The project uses pip for dependency management, with all requirements specified in `requirements.txt`. Key dependencies include:

- ccxt (3.0.37): Exchange API integration
- pandas (1.5.3): Data analysis
- numpy (1.24.3): Numerical computations
