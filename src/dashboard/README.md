## Overview

The Algorithmic Trading Dashboard is a web-based monitoring and visualization system for the Bybit trading platform. It provides real-time insights into trading performance, market data, orderbook analysis, and strategy management. Built with Dash and Flask, the dashboard offers an interactive interface for monitoring and controlling the algorithmic trading system.

## Architecture

The dashboard follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components

1. **Application Layer**: The `app.py` serves as the entry point and manages the Dash application lifecycle.
2. **Layout System**: Reusable UI layouts and components for different dashboard sections.
3. **Data Services**: Centralized data providers that fetch and process data from various trading system components.
4. **Router**: Handles URL routing and page navigation.
5. **Callback System**: Manages interactive updates and user interactions.
6. **Utilities**: Helper functions, formatters, validators, and other utilities.

### Design Patterns

- **Service Pattern**: Data services abstract the complexity of data retrieval and processing.
- **Callback Pattern**: Dash callbacks handle user interactions and dynamic updates.
- **Component-based Architecture**: UI is composed of reusable components.
- **Lazy Loading**: Components are loaded on-demand to improve performance.

## Key Components

### Layouts

The dashboard is organized into multiple tabs/sections:

1. **Performance Panel**: Displays trading performance metrics, equity curves, drawdown analysis, and return distributions.
2. **Trading Panel**: Shows active trades, order history, and provides trade execution controls.
3. **Orderbook Panel**: Visualizes market depth, liquidity, and orderbook imbalances.
4. **Strategy Panel**: Displays active strategies, strategy performance, and configuration options.
5. **Settings Panel**: Provides system configuration, parameter tuning, and other settings.

### Services

1. **Data Service**: Central service for retrieving and processing data from various system components.
2. **Chart Service**: Generates interactive Plotly charts for performance visualization.
3. **Notification Service**: Manages system notifications and alerts.
4. **Update Service**: Handles background data refreshing and periodic updates.

### Components

Various reusable UI components such as:

- Performance metrics cards
- Equity curve graphs
- Trading tables
- Orderbook visualizations
- Strategy control panels
- Error displays
- Loading indicators

## Data Flow

1. **Data Acquisition**:

   - Live data from trading system components (trade manager, performance tracker, etc.)
   - Historical data for performance analysis
   - Market data from exchange APIs

2. **Data Processing**:

   - The `DashboardDataService` processes raw data into dashboard-friendly formats
   - Data is cached to minimize redundant processing
   - Data freshness is tracked to manage update frequency

3. **Data Visualization**:

   - Processed data is rendered through Plotly graphs and Dash components
   - Interactive components allow users to filter and explore data

4. **User Interaction**:

   - User inputs trigger Dash callbacks
   - Callbacks may update displayed data or execute trading system actions
   - Changes are reflected in real-time across the dashboard

5. **System Integration**:
   - The dashboard integrates with various components of the trading system
   - It can both display data from and send commands to the trading system
