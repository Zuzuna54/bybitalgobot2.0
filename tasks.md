## Trading Strategy Logic

### 1. EMA Crossover Strategy

- **Signal Generation**: Buy when short-term EMA crosses above long-term EMA, sell when it crosses below
- **Parameters**: Fast EMA period (9), Slow EMA period (21)
- **Filters**: Confirm with volume increase

### 2. RSI Overbought/Oversold Reversal

- **Signal Generation**: Buy when RSI falls below 30 then rises, sell when RSI rises above 70 then falls
- **Parameters**: RSI period (14), Overbought level (70), Oversold level (30)
- **Filters**: Confirm with candlestick patterns

### 3. Bollinger Bands Mean Reversion

- **Signal Generation**: Buy near lower band with RSI<40, sell near upper band with RSI>60
- **Parameters**: Bollinger Bands period (20), Standard deviation (2)
- **Filters**: Avoid trading in strong trends (determined by ADX)

### 4. MACD Trend Following

- **Signal Generation**: Buy when MACD line crosses above signal line, sell when it crosses below
- **Parameters**: Fast EMA (12), Slow EMA (26), Signal EMA (9)
- **Filters**: Only trade when histogram is increasing (for buys) or decreasing (for sells)

### 5. Breakout Trading Strategy

- **Signal Generation**: Buy when price breaks above resistance with increased volume, sell when breaks below support
- **Parameters**: Lookback period (20), Volume threshold (1.5x average)
- **Filters**: Confirm with RSI direction

### 6. VWAP Trend Trading

- **Signal Generation**: Buy when price crosses above VWAP, sell when it crosses below
- **Parameters**: VWAP period (daily)
- **Filters**: Only trade when price is already trending in the anticipated direction

### 7. ATR-Based Volatility Scalping

- **Signal Generation**: Buy when price moves up by X% of ATR from a low, sell when it moves down by X% from a high
- **Parameters**: ATR period (14), Movement threshold (1.5x ATR)
- **Filters**: Only trade during high volatility periods

### 8. ADX Strength Confirmation

- **Signal Generation**: Buy when +DI crosses above -DI and ADX>25, sell when -DI crosses above +DI and ADX>25
- **Parameters**: ADX period (14), Minimum strength threshold (25)
- **Filters**: Only trade when ADX is rising

### 9. Golden Cross & Death Cross Strategy

- **Signal Generation**: Buy on Golden Cross (50 SMA crosses above 200 SMA), sell on Death Cross (50 SMA crosses below 200 SMA)
- **Parameters**: Fast MA (50), Slow MA (200)
- **Filters**: Confirm with volume and momentum indicators

### 10. Keltner Channel Breakout

- **Signal Generation**: Buy when price breaks above upper Keltner Channel, sell when breaks below lower channel
- **Parameters**: Keltner period (20), ATR multiplier (2.0)
- **Filters**: Only trade when ADX indicates a strong trend

## Risk Management Rules

### Position Sizing

- Maximum position size: 5% of portfolio per trade
- Scaling: Increase position size after 3 consecutive profitable trades, decrease after a loss
- Leverage: Starting at 2x, adaptive based on volatility (lower during high volatility)

### Stop Loss Management

- Technical Stop Loss: Based on recent swing points (for trend strategies) or indicator extremes (for reversal strategies)
- Volatility-Based Stop Loss: 2x ATR from entry price
- Time-Based Stop Loss: Close position if not profitable within X periods

### Take Profit Management

- Tiered take-profit levels: 25% at 1:1 risk/reward, 50% at 2:1, 25% at 3:1
- Trailing stop: Activated after reaching 1.5x risk/reward ratio
- Trailing calibration: Based on ATR and recent volatility

### Risk Controls

- Maximum daily drawdown: 3% of portfolio
- Maximum open positions: 5 concurrent trades
- Correlated asset limits: Maximum 2 trades in highly correlated assets
- Circuit breaker: Pause trading after 3 consecutive losses

## Testing & Debugging

### Backtesting Protocol

1. Validate each strategy individually on 1-year historical data
2. Test combined system on 2-year data across different market conditions
3. Perform walk-forward analysis to validate parameter stability
4. Conduct Monte Carlo simulations to estimate risk/reward distributions

### Paper Trading Validation

1. Run all strategies in paper trading mode for at least 2 weeks
2. Compare live results with backtest expectations
3. Analyze latency and execution quality
4. Refine parameters based on live market behavior

### Performance Metrics

- Daily/weekly/monthly returns
- Sharpe and Sortino ratios
- Maximum drawdown
- Win/loss ratio
- Average profit per trade
- Time in market
- Correlation to market movements

## Future Enhancements

1. Machine Learning integration for pattern recognition
2. Sentiment analysis from social media and news
3. Enhanced execution optimization using limit order placement algorithms
4. Multi-timeframe analysis to improve entry/exit timing
5. Portfolio-level optimization across multiple assets
6. Advanced risk parity techniques for better capital allocation
7. Integration with additional exchanges for arbitrage opportunities
8. Custom indicator development based on performance analysis
9. Market regime detection for better strategy selection
10. Event-driven trading capabilities for news and economic announcements

## Recommendations for Completion

To complete this project, focus on the following priorities:

1. Implement the remaining 7 trading strategies
2. Complete the paper trading module functionality
3. Build order book analysis for optimized entries/exits
4. Create a monitoring dashboard
5. Develop deployment scripts and continuous operation capabilities
